# Goal of project 
The goal of this project is to play around with Paypal to see if I can hook up a VueJS app to Paypal to accept payments on a website.

## Version 1

Seems to work fine : just with one product.
Created a Paypal Sandbox account with a Sandbox login which can be used to test payment functionality.
Seems to all work.

## Version 2

Added separate page for product detail and added the payment there also.
Also reduced the size of the payment button to a more reasonable size
Also added the products as a flexbox for display, and just tidied them up.
Finally finished with my sandbox testing API key so tried out the live API key!
